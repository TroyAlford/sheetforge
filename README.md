# SheetForge
RPG gaming JS, CSS and other custom character sheet rendering content.

## Local Development
In order to get this package running locally, use use `npm install`, then`grunt watch`, which will ensure that any change you make to files in the `src` directory are compiled and copied immediately to the `bin` directory (affecting the `examples`).

If you want to just include the CSS or JS from this project in your application, I suggest just doing a `git clone` of the `bin` directory by itself.

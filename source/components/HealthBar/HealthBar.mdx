## Health Bar Component
The `Character` model supports two different types of health. Simple numeric health (hitpoints) are best represented with the `Attribute` component. For systems which have more complex health models, however, `HealthBar` is used to manage each `HealthLevel`'s level of damage independently.

Each `HealthLevel` allows one of four possible settings for its `damage` property:
 - `'none'` means _uninjured_
 - `'light'` indicates bruising or superficial damage
 - `'heavy'` indicates lascerations, broken bones, or deep flesh wounds
 - `'bane'` indicates supernatural or otherwise difficult-to-heal damage

  {() => {
    const HealthBarModel = types.array(HealthLevel)
    const health = HealthBarModel.create([
      { displayName: 'Healthy', damage: 'bane' },
      { displayName: 'Bruised', damage: 'heavy', penalty: 1 },
      { displayName: 'Injured', damage: 'light', penalty: 2 },
      { displayName: 'Crippled', damage: 'none', penalty: 3 },
      { displayName: 'Incapacitated', penalty: 5 },
    ])
